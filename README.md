# Money_Laundering_Detection
A machine learning-based system using 8 models (KNN, DNN, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Linear Regression, XGBoost, SVM, Random Forest) with a Streamlit web interface for real-time fraud detection and model comparison.
The Fraud Detection System uses 8 machine learning and deep learning models—KNN, DNN, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Linear Regression, XGBoost, SVM, and Random Forest—to classify financial transactions as fraudulent or non-fraudulent. The system features a Streamlit web interface for user interaction, allowing real-time input, model selection, and result display. The project is structured with essential files for datasets, serialized models, and the main app.py to run the web app. To use, clone the repository, install the dependencies from requirements.txt, and run the app using streamlit run app.py. Users can input transaction details, select a model, and predict the transaction's status. The system enables easy comparison of model performance in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Built with Python, it employs libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and XGBoost. Contributions are welcome, and for any issues, users can reach out via sanketjha177@gmail.com.
